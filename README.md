Doushiryoku Check is a Japanese verb conjugation testing website to help Japanese learners test or improve their verb conjugation abilities.
Users can choose from three test modes and an array of conjugation options including auxiliary forms, and be tested using verbs from any chosen JLPT level.

More conjugation forms and options are planned to be added in the future.

The website is made using React and written in TypeScript, uses MUI for UI elements, and is currently hosted using Firebase. It checks answers are correct by using my TypeScript library, jv-conjugator (https://github.com/dan-turner-djt/jv-conjugator) on the backend.

The backend Express.js Node.js server for this website, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, is here: https://github.com/dan-turner-djt/Doushiryokucheck_backend
