Doushiryoku Check is a Japanese verb conjugation testing website to help Japanese learners test or improve their verb conjugation abilities.
Users can choose from three test modes and an array of conjugation options including auxiliary forms, and be tested using verbs from any chosen JLPT level.

More conjugation forms and options are planned to be added in the future.

The website is made using React and written in typescript, and uses MUI for UI elements. It also uses my typescript library, jv-conjugator (https://github.com/dan-turner-djt/jv-conjugator), to check answers are correct.

The backend Express.js Node.js server for this website, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, is here: https://github.com/dan-turner-djt/Doushiryokucheck_backend
